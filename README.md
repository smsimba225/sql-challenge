Intro to SQL!

This challenge was a great introduction to the basics of SQL.  It is really interesting to see how easily SQL can handle very large amounts of data without batting an eye.

We used software to map out the ERD, which made it very easy to identify our Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.  

After the tables were set up and the data was imported, using SQL to pull information was simple!

I especially enjoyed utilizing subqueries to obtain data in one step!

Thank you for looking at my work!
